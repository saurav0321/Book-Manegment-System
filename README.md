BMS (Book Management System) is a software solution designed to manage and organize books in a library or bookstore. It enables users to add, update, and delete book records, search for books by title, author, or genre, and track their availability. The system allows administrators to manage the inventory, while users can easily browse through the collection. It simplifies tasks such as tracking borrowed books, generating reports, and managing stock efficiently. BMS helps improve the overall management of book-related operations and enhances the user experience.
